defmodule SymphonyElixir.Planning.Auditor do
  @moduledoc """
  Summarizes the WIP branch's existing diff against its base, so the Planner
  can mark rows `partial` or `done` instead of fresh-start `missing` for
  work that's already on the branch.

  Without this, the Planner trusts only the issue body, and the issue body
  is often stale relative to what's been pushed to the WIP branch (sub-agents
  land work; nobody updates the issue body). The Planner then generates a
  plan that reinvents committed code.

  The audit summary is intentionally compact — file list, commit subject
  list, line-count stats — not the full diff. Planner doesn't need the diff
  text; it needs to know "files X, Y, Z have been touched; commits A, B, C
  reference contracts 02-04". The Planner makes the partial/done call from
  there.

  We use `gh` for diff metadata so the Auditor doesn't depend on a slot —
  it can run from the orchestrator dir using the GitHub API.

    likely `partial` — there's progress but the issue body hasn't been
